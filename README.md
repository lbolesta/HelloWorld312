Three options to compile 
first option is the most simple, no special flags for compiling. 

use visual studio and compile using the GUI. 

OR g++ can be used. 

OR using the standard c++ compiler for windows,
from VisualStudio developer command prompt.... cl /EHsc Source.cpp to compile 
then Source at the command line to run. Should display "Hello, World. My name is Lauren."
